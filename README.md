# reflections-on-presentations

For each presentation, copy-and-paste then fill-in-the-blanks.  You must comment on at least one thing. 



Title of presentation:  fragile family

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:

They described dataset carefully, precisely.  

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:

We did not see any exact example or say final prediction from the model. They used several models and functions but the did not explain 

but why they chose those. 

Why they keep only diverse responses from the data ?

How they interpret the predictors selected by the lasso function. Do these predictors have special meaning which

other predictors do not have ?



Title of presentation:  Mass shooting

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:

They showed the whole procedure that how they got data, what was the background of gun shooting, how many news about guns, is there any 

political reasons for gun purchases, how they analyzed data step by step. The plots are fatanstic. 

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:

I saw a seasonal trend and an upward trend in the gun purchase plot. There are many information they can extract from it, but they did not

do that.

They did not describe their dataset, what does response variable look like, what about those predictors ? 

What happened about the big spot at the top right corner in plot from the second page of their slides, what do the slopes mean ?



Title of presentation: VOTE

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:

The slide is clean and colorful. The information they want to show is well arranged. 

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:

The analysis they do is mostly represented by speaking, under the condition that we are not familiar with the data, we are easily lost 

while we are listening.

What are the results of your analysis ? Do those results really help us understand voting behavior ? 



Title of presentation: YELP

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:

The analysis structure is complete and well arranged.

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:

What kind of group of people uses YELP often, do they tend to give certain kind of feedback? for example, I myself seldom give bad 

feedback, but often share good experience, so if this case happens often, we expect to get higher grades for many restaurants.

I think the number of predictors in this dateset is not enough to do such analysis. 


Title of presentation: Crime 

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:

Plots are beautiful. Statistically, their analysis is delicate. 

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:

I could not see the x-axis from plot showing crimes counting per day, so I do not know what do these curves mean.
